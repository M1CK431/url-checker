# <img alt="logo" src="../webapp/public/url-checker.png" align="left" height="38" /> URL Checker

API for URL Checker, a tool to easily check URLs in a sitemap.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

* At least [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18.12 is required (but always use latest LTS if possible)
* Only Linux based systems are officially supported
* API is using [curl](https://curl.se/) for URL checking, at least v7.70 must be installed

### Install dependencies for Production

Once placed in the `api` directory:

```sh
pnpm i -P
```

### Installation

For obvious security reason, create a dedicated system user/group:

```sh
useradd --system -s /usr/bin/nologin -U url-checker
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If you use another user/group name, don't forget to update the systemd service `User` and `Group` directives (see below).

The API only need write access to its sqlite db:

```sh
chown url-checker: ./db.sqlite
chmod 644 ./db.sqlite
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Other files should be owned by another user/group (`root` for example)\
‚ö†Ô∏è Other files should be read-only for anyone (`644` permissions).

Then copy (or symlink) the provided systemd service and enable/start it:

```sh
ln -sn /etc/systemd/system/url-checker.service ./url-checker.service
# OR, if you need to adapt it for your setup
cp -a ./url-checker.service /etc/systemd/system/

chown root: /etc/systemd/system/url-checker.service
chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/url-checker.service

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now url-checker
```

üéâÔ∏è That's it! The API should now be up and running on default [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql)

‚ÑπÔ∏è By default, nothing is publicly exposed. See [Setup with Apache web server](../webapp/README.md#setup-with-apache-web-server) for a reverse proxy configuration example.

### Customize configuration

There are some settings you can change as environment variables:

| Name                | Default       | Description                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HOST`            | `localhost` | Host to listen on                                             |
| `PORT`            | `3000`      | Port to listen on                                             |
| `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` | `[]`        | Array of allowed**domains hostname** to check           |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MS`   | `1000`      | Single URL check rate limit (in ms)                           |
| `REDIRECT_LIMIT`  | `10`        | Max internal cascading redirections to follow                 |
| `CURL`            | `curl`      | `curl` binary to use (see [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)) |

A sample [environment file](./.env.development) is provided with default values for the development environnement.\
Example `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` valid value: `["toto.com", "titi.fr"]`.

## Upgrade

The simplest way to upgrade the API is using the following `git` commands in the monorepo directory (where `.git` stands):

```sh
git fetch
git reset --hard origin/master
```

Then redo the [Install dependencies for Production](#install-dependencies-for-production) step and restart the API systemd service:

```sh
systemctl restart url-checker
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If you have copied the systemd service (for example to use a user/group different from the default),
please ensure that nothing was changed in this file in the upgraded version.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Notice that this will upgrade both API and Webapp so don't forget to also follow [Webapp upgrade instructions](../webapp/README.md#upgrade).

## Troubleshooting

In case you see this error message while trying to check a single URL:

```
ApolloError: Response not successful: Received status code 503
```

You are probably affected by [this curl bug](https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/6905).
No worries, I have a good news for you: a simple workaround is available!

Copy `.env.development` to `.env.production` and change `CURL` env variable with:

```ini
CURL=./curl_7.76.1_workaround_wrapper
```

‚ö†Ô∏è `curl_7.76.1_workaround_wrapper` must be set as executable:

```sh
chmod 755 ./curl_7.76.1_workaround_wrapper
```

Then restart the API systemd service:

```sh
systemctl restart url-checker
```

Everything should now works properly.
